Instagram Clone UI (Html, CSS)

This project involves creating a web-based clone of Instagram using the MERN stack. The primary components of the clone include:

1.Sidebar: A simple sidebar featuring icons and a list structure using ul and li tags. This element is styled using CSS to fix its position and maintain its width.

2.Story Section: Utilizes Flexbox to display a row of stories. Each story is a combination of an image and text, formatted to appear as circular icons with captions.

3.Posts Section: Another Flexbox layout that is more intricate. This section displays individual posts with images, user interactions (like, comment, share), and comments.

4.Footer Section: Contains user details, suggestion lists, and navigational links. Styled to stay at the bottom of the page.
